  texts:
  - Poor road infrastructure slows deliveries and causes food to spoil before it
    reaches markets.
  - When transport routes are damaged, food supplies become unreliable for entire
    regions.
  - Lack of road maintenance increases delays, raising costs and reducing available
    food.
  - In rural areas, broken roads often prevent food from reaching people who need
    it most.
  - Without reliable transport, farmers cannot sell food even when it is available.
  - Long travel times increase waste, especially for fresh and perishable food.
  - Weak infrastructure turns small disruptions into large food shortages.
  - Heavy rain and flooding regularly block roads, cutting off food deliveries in
    vulnerable regions.
  - Extreme weather slows transport and increases food loss before it reaches consumers.
  - Climate-driven weather events disrupt supply chains long after storms pass.
  - Poorly built roads fail quickly under bad weather, isolating communities.
  - Changing climate patterns make food transport increasingly unpredictable.
  - When transport halts during storms, food prices rise due to scarcity.
  - Delays during transport increase spoilage and reduce how much food survives the
    journey.
  - Perishable food often expires before arrival when transport is slow or unreliable.
  - Longer routes mean higher losses, even when enough food is produced.
  - Food waste during transport directly reduces what reaches markets and aid centers.
  - Time lost on the road often determines whether food is usable or discarded.
  - In unsafe regions, food is frequently lost to theft, damage, or forced abandonment.
  - Conflict along trade routes reduces the amount of food that reaches civilians.
  - Armed groups and crime increase transport costs and limit food access.
  - Fear and insecurity force drivers to abandon routes entirely.
  - Instability disrupts food movement even when supplies exist nearby.
  - Extra transport costs raise food prices, making it unaffordable for many people.
  - When moving food becomes expensive, low-income communities are hit first.
  - High transport costs prevent food from reaching areas with the greatest need.
  - Limited funding means fewer repairs, worsening long-term food access.
  - Rising delivery costs reduce how much food aid organizations can distribute.
  - Hunger often comes from failures in distribution, not a lack of food.
  - Food shortages frequently result from broken systems rather than low production.
  - When supply chains fail, surplus food exists alongside hunger.
  - Reliable transport is as critical as food production in preventing hunger.
  - Small disruptions compound across long routes, reducing food availability.
